# Claude Instructions

This project follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) pattern for modular, reusable coding guidelines.

## Agent Skills

All coding guidelines are defined in the `skills/` directory. ALWAYS check them!

## Workflow

- Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementations, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious. Look for the best sub agent for the several tasks.
  Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write to the file.
- **NEVER write out markdown files unless explicitly asked to**
